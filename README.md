# predict-which-visitors-are-more-likely-to-submit-a-lead-form

Background: X’s Digital team tracks behavior of web visitors on X.com website. The attached data gives information about web activity of our online visitors sourced from Paid Search over a month. This is a free form analysis and either R or Python can be used to run the analysis. Here are some general expectations:

Analyze the data to identify patterns
Identify anomalies/outlier in the data
Try to predict which visitors are more likely to submit a lead form
Create a power point presentation of 10-15 slides outlining the analysis process and final outcome
Send over the power point slides and any code that was used to conduct the analysis
Review the case study over the phone with hiring manager (15 minutes)
To understand the data better I have visited X.com and tried to get the quote Questions are listed below
